# Sadness Chan
A chat 'bot' for FoundryVTT that's full of 'happy' and 'motivational' messages, to pick you up when your rolls let you down. 


# Instalation
- Inside Foundry, select the Game Modules tab in the Configuration and Setup menu.
- Click the Install Module button and enter the following URL:
 
FoundryVTT version <= 0.6.5: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmarian/sadness-chan/master/src/module.json`
FoundryVTT version >= 0.6.6: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmarian/sadness-chan/f-0.7.x/src/module.json`

- Click Install and wait for installation to complete.


# Usage
Just play, like you would usually do and Sadness Chan will send you 'happy' whispers on critical fails and successes ðŸ˜Š.

Or, if you need a 'pick-me-up' just type `!sadness` in the chat and blame the stats on the random generator.

### In case you are too special for any of the default settings, you can just change them, I guess...

### You can also modify all my 'cute' messages, if any of them are too spicy for you `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`

### You can just reset everything if you're too ashamed of what you've done.
- `!sadness reset settings`
- `!sadness reset lists`
- `!sadness reset counter`
